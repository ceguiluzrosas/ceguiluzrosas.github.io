						<p>In our research phase, our team collaborated on Google Docs, and spoke about the different mask types that we had seen thus far. After asking outselves “What masks are currently offered?”, we created a table listing 13 products and wrote down the pros and negative cons of each mask.</p>
						<p>The second question asked was, “What are different groups of people that might have different needs for masks?” It was important that we uncover the set of users who may have difficulty using the average mask as it allowed us to establish more unique use cases for the masks and integrate that research into our ideation.</p>

						<!-- <p>Will's most recent mask experience was wearing a mask to go pick up dinner at Chipotle. He noted that he used a washable mask, which he keeps on a hook next to the door, and did not take it off prior to getting home. He walked to Chipotle to pick up a dinner order that he had placed online, walked back home, and then took his mask off. Some questions that were asked during this interview:</p> 
						<ul>
							<li>Did you have to talk to the people inside the store at Chipotle? <u>No, I placed the order for pick-up online so that it was a friction-less experience.</u></li>
							<li>Did you have to adjust your mask while on your walk? <u>Yes, once or twice.</u></li> 
							<li>Was it hard to breathe in the mask? <u>It was a little harder to breathe than normal.</u></li>
							<li>Did you take off the mask? <u>No, because it’s more work to take it off and put it back on constantly.</u></li>

						<p>Katie had worn a mask to go to a HIIT class in the park. She noted that she uses a different mask for different situations such as exercising, and going to a populated place.</p>
						<div class="quote">
							<p><i>Today, it was humid and a hard class, and I had more trouble than usual breathing through the mask, but I still kept it on except for water breaks. When I drank water, I took it off on one side - everyone was socially distanced, so I felt comfortable doing it.</i></p>

						<p>When asked about how masks have altered her interactions with people, she said that it was harder to hear people and awkward to repeat ourselves especially during during professional settings.</p>
						<!-- <p>Some questions that were asked during this interview:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Has the mask changed your interactions with people? <u>Yes - it’s harder to hear people, and we have to repeat ourselves a lot, which is especially awkward in professional situations.</u></li>

						<p>When asked about the risk of taking off her mask at a restaurant, Xindi acknowledged it and mentioned having to inspect everyone around her to see what they were doing. Her safety is her top concern, hence she always picks the highest certified mask before embarking on any activity.</p>
						<!-- <ul>
							<li>Did you feel a risk when you took off the mask at the restaurant? <u>Yes. I checked everyone around me - people at the restaurant, other tables, to see what they were doing.</u></li>
							<li>Do you have different masks for different purposes? <u>When I go shopping and am around other people, I wear an N95 mask because it is more safe. I never wear an uncertified mask because I want to be safest.</u></li>
							<li>How has your behavior changed? <u>I used to like running outside near the water, but it’s uncomfortable to do it with a mask on. Now I exercise at home, and I can’t go to the gym because I am required to wear a mask.</u></li>
							<li>What other concerns do you have about masks? <u>I think masks should be water proof to be determined as “safe,” and am wary of “reusable” and “washable” masks - I think that I wear a mask to protect myself, so I pick the highest certified mask to protect myself.</u></li>

					<div class="subheading">
						<p>We synthesized our research finding and redefined our problem by orginzing our insights into clusters of different experiences while avoiding any over-generalizations.</p>
						<p>We found that, in general, there was confusion over the real definition of “safe” masks. Although we are being told how to be safe by many parties (with differing opinions, mind you), we found that <u>consumers ultimately make the choice of how safe they want to be</u> by asking themselves who they are wearing the mask to protect: themselves or others? 
						<div class="text-center">
							<img class="big-proto-img" src="./graphics/choice.png">
							<p class="caption">Some Americans are protesting against the state-wide health-mandate of wearing masks in public.</p>

						<br>
						<!-- And finding that the answer to this question sometimes changes our behaviors and masks that we use. Each person’s level of comfort depends on the information and media one is shown, as well as the environment they are in. This led us to wanting to create a solution that creates a system of consistency and well-distributed information.</p> -->
						<p>We also found that COVID-19 has changed human behavior into planning more before interacting with anyone. We pre-order food, use different masks for different situations, and choose different ways to protect ourselves (i.e. subway vs exercising outside). Most people have multiple masks for different purposes, and acknowledge that there are different scales of risks. Knowing this helps us account for the spectrum of mask-related experiences and help us create a solution that is adaptable to those experiences.</p>
						<p>A final observation was that masks are perceived differently by different people. Some people expressed that there is a judgement that comes with wearing masks, particularly in different areas of the United States. At some point, N95 masks were the only masks that were perceived as safe, but regulations and behaviors have relaxed. We realized that <u>we do not live the scientific process in real time. Sometimes people do not understand how the science is produced and vetted, and oftentimes the communication of risk is difficult</u>.</p>

							<li>How might we help users who wish to wear a mask remember to do so?</li>
