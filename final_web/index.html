                        Our team’s design problem was to create a public-interest technology
                        (PIT) that would <mark>benefit librarians in terms of knowledge sharing</mark>. More specifically, 
                        we aimed to create a tool that would <mark>help librarians make exceptions to rules when 
                        needed for high-need groups and support access to digital tools when patrons preferred 
                        analog mediums</mark>. Our PIT was inspired by our interviews with librarians and staff who 
                        indicated that there was a gap to be filled in terms of communication between librarians 
                        and patrons, as well as accessing and assisting patrons who are unable to come into the 
                        library, particularly in this age of COVID-19.

                            After developing the 3 HMW's above, we generated <mark>30 potential ideas</mark> for how we can benefit librarian communication. 
                            From these 30 different ideas, we unanimously decided on four to which we then focused on combined two to create 
                            a <mark>"Hybrid Prototype"</mark> that brings the best value onto our mission. To provide some background, the two ideas we fused were the <u>Searchable 
                            FAQ</u> and the <u>Forum/Polling Board</u>.

                        The following are some of the challenges and opportunities that came about from following
                        the PIT Double Diamond design process. We hope our experience serves as an example for 
                        future designers and developers who choose to use this approach.
                        <br><br>

                                you’re observing</mark>. In our case, we documented both the technology infrastructure
                                present in library systems (ex. computers/tablets, communication platforms, public and
                                librarian-only websites), and the social infrastructure manifested from patron-librarian
                                communications and the communities (growing within/living in/inhabiting/entering)
                                the library.

                                The “PIT Double Diamond” process will make sure that your <mark>final design is a precise
                                reflection of the actual needs requested by your target audience and not those which
                                might’ve assumed during the initial phase</mark>. Repeating the cycle of “Research,
                                Prototype, and Testing” phases may filter and/or conglomerate several ideas until you
                                obtain the right one.

                                Figuring <mark>how NOT to design an overzealous application that infringes on the daily
                                lives</mark> of your target user will be an interesting challenge. In some cases, like ours, your
                                research and interviews will uncover a significant problem that can be solved with the
                                simplest, yet most meaningful and beneficial application.
