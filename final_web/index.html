                        (PIT) tool that would <mark>support librarians in their quotidien work through knowledge sharing</mark>.

                        </a>, and other public libraries in the United States,
                        we primarily considered how we might <mark>help librarians make exceptions to rules when 
                        needed for high-need groups</mark>. The scope of our PIT tool focuses on creating a tool that would 
                        redirect the day-to-day labor of librarians who are tasked with assisting patrons toward a more permanent resource that could continuously serve as a form of knowledge sharing, as opposed to fleeting and temporary interactions.

                                We found that the public's perception on a library's success is typically based on statute numbers (ex. # of patrons, # of books lent) and not on the 
                                valuable (free) services that libraries provide to the public (ex. GED classes and Learn-to-Read programs). 
                                This perception influences how the public donates and how governing-officials allocate funds to their regional library systems.

                            Our low-fidelity and mid-fidelity prototypes were chiefly based on an early desire to tailor the tool around the needs 
                            of patrons who prefer analog mediums or may not feel comfortable with digital tools.  Therefore, the early digital 
                            solutions focused on keeping them focused, short, and simple. <mark>We wanted the (final) design to be adaptable to many different 
                            types of users</mark>. Interfaces were "brought back to basics" by asking simple, direct questions.  Reducing the visual 
                            impact of the interface allowed the functionality and straight-forwardness of the tool to be front and center. 
                            Therefore, white backgrounds with grey highlights were chosen as the base colors, brighter colors--such as blue or 
                            green-- were sparingly used for specific purposes such as ‘Submit’ buttons or update notifications.  No iconography was 
                            implemented in the (final) prototype; however, custom icons could theoretically be implemented in order to differentiate the 
                            implementation of this system in different library systems.  One analysis of note in the development of the prototypes was 
                            connecting the ideate phase back to new areas of exploration</mark> found during the ideation exercise; this allowed us to 
                            <mark>capitalize on the ‘invisible labor’ of librarian staff responding to questions, but not documenting those responses in 
                            a way that is useful for others that may have that same question</mark>.  This was a key insight in developing a symbiotic tool 
                            of mutual aid for patrons and librarians.

                            Given this final round of feedback, we can conclude that our tests capture both usability and accessibility from all participating users thanks to the 
                            tool’s seamless navigation and access to important functionalities. While they don’t capture the likelihood of patrons interacting with the platform as 
                            opposed to contacting the librarian directly, we can conclude that both patrons and librarians will find it favorable to be part of the 
                            knowledge-sharing community that our tool builds.

                                Make note of all <mark>visible and invisible infrastructures present within the environment
                                you’re observing</mark>. In our case, we documented both the technology infrastructure
                                present in library systems (ex. computers/tablets, communication platforms, public and
                                librarian-only websites), and the social infrastructure manifested from patron-librarian
                                communications and the communities (growing within/living in/inhabiting/entering)
                                the library.

                                The “PIT Double Diamond” process will make sure that your <mark>final design is a precise
                                reflection of the actual needs requested by your target audience and not those which
                                might’ve assumed during the initial phase</mark>. Repeating the cycle of “Research,
                                Prototype, and Testing” phases may filter and/or conglomerate several ideas until you
                                obtain the right one.

                                Figuring <mark>how NOT to design an overzealous application that infringes on the daily
                                lives</mark> of your target user will be an interesting challenge. In some cases, like ours, your
                                research and interviews will uncover a significant problem that can be solved with the
                                simplest, yet most meaningful and beneficial application.

                        We would like to thank all the librarians and library staff we’ve interviewed throughout this semester for 
                        educating us on their day-to-day lives and for providing us with the insights
                        necessary to create our tool.
